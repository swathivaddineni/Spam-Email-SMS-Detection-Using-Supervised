ðŸ“© Spam Email/sms Detection using Supervised Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting spam emails using supervised machine learning techniques. The model classifies emails as 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam) based on the textual content of the emails.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset.

The dataset used is the SMS/Email Spam Collection dataset. It contains labeled examples of messages categorized as spam or ham.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the email text data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Used TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Sample Predictions

| Email Message                                      | Predicted Label |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card."  | Spam            |
| "Meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 10 AM."        | Ham             |
| "Get cheap loans instantly with no credit check!" | Spam            |
